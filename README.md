### PART 3: Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control
### Project 3: System integration with ROS

In this final project of the Self Driving Car nanodegree program (CarND), I write ROS nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including control and waypoint following. I test the code using a simulator. Because I work alone, I don't have the chance to run the code on a real car.

The following is a system architecture diagram showing the ROS nodes and topics used in the project.

 The code I've modified for the project is within the `(path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/` directory.
